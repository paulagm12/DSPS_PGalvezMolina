Paula's repository for the Data Science for Physical Scientist class 2023 (PHYS461)

1. Why did I decide to take the class?
   The last past 9 months I worked as a data analyst for the Guatemalan government running gender statistics. I would like to learn more (and more advanced techniques) on data analysis to make better studies of the situation of women and other marginalized groups in my country. I also hope to learn more strategies to improve my coding and analysis skills to be used in my research.

2. What do I hope to learn the most?
   I would love to learn more how to take more advantage of libraries ans packages used in Python for data analysis. Additionally, I also hope to learn more about best practices for displaying data.

3. What are some strengths in my character or background that might help me in this class?
   I think that my experience in descriptive data analysis might help me feel more comfortable with coding and looking for solutions to my programming questions. From my personality, I think I have improved my skills for working in groups which I expect to be benefitial if needed to work collaboratively for the classs.
