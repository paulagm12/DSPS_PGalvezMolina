This assignment was worked in collaboration with Rayta Pradata. While I mostly worked independently, I consulted and helped a few with other peers with them as needed. I also consulted with some other people from the class (like Zach, Tali, Masooma, Sarah, and Miles).
Rayta helped me set up (importing libraries and fixing initial bugs) the document for the dark matter assignment, and I helped her set up the MH MCMC notebook. We mostly discussed on the instructions for the assignment as well as the theory behind the MH MCMC method.
I helped Masooma, Rayta, and Sarah with the analysis portion (vratio function) of the Dark Matter assignment. I recevied guidance from Miles for fixing a bug in my graphing function, and what value to use from Wikipedia as the apparent size for Andromeda from Tali and Zach.

The homework aimed to gives us experience writing general functions for usage accross different data sets. The second assignment gave us experience writing a MH MCMC handler. 

The hardest part of the first assignment was understanding how to calculate the ratios (I later on confirmed with Dr. Bianco my equation for calculated ratios as I did not want to bother Willow again, sorry for the many questions Willow). 
For the second assignemnt, the hardest part was understanding the theory of the MH MCMC method. There were a lot of technical words that I did not understand and made it hard to understand what the auther explained. After discussions with Rayta and using ChatGPT for rephrasing the given text, I understood it.

I learned how to plot errorbars, do a quick analysis of galactic data, and what is and how to apply a MH MCMC method.
