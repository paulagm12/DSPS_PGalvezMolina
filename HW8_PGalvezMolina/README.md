My old plot was:

Both are a TSNE 2D projection of the kidpack data base. In orange (before yellow) is the projection with an Early Exaggeration of 5 and perplexity of 5. In blue the same data but with the default paramenters (Early Exaggeration of 12 and Perplexity of 30.0). This was my graph from HW7.

I changed the order of the plotting so that the blue set was on top of the oragnge (before yellow) and it could actually be seen. I also changed the yellow to orange to increase visibility and contrast, and I made the markers smaller so that each data point was better visualized and did not look like a blob.

It is important to notice that changing the paremeters of the TSNE did not change the shape of the distribution in the projeciton.
