This assignment was worked in collaboration with Shar Daniels, Tali Natan, and Rayta Pradata, however, I mostly worked independently and consulted mainly with them as needed.
I also consulted with some other people from the class (like Masooma and Miles).

The homework aimed to gives us experience using the Kolmogorv-Smirnov (KS) statistical test by reproducing √Ålvaro Corral's 2018 paper on inter-evet times eartquakes in California.
The paper applied the KS test to the normalized time gaps between earthquakes in given periods of time to determine if they followed the same distribution. 

The hardest part of the assignment was working understanding how to replicate the data analysis portion of the paper (paragraph 3 section 3).
I mostly struggled with getting the correct p-values (still undetermined why they are not in closer agreement to those presented by the paper).

On the other hand, the easist was to perfom the data cleaning and exploration. 

I learned how to broadcast, I have never done data selection using that method before, and I found it very efficient and easy to use.
