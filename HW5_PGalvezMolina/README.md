This assignment was worked in collaboration with Rayta Pradata, Sarah Dellorco, Masooma Sarfraz, and Tali Natan, while I mostly worked independently, I consulted with them a few times. I mostly consulted with TA Willow and Prof. Bianco.

The homework had as a main goal to have us use MH-MCMC method to do model fits (linear and broken power law) and compare them visually. It gave us experience writing general functions for the posterior, likelihood, and prior of a distribution, using the pythog package "emcee" to facilitate the implementation of the  MH-MCMC.

The hardest part was understanding how to set up the prior, likelihood, and posterior distributions. I also struggled understanding that the goal was also to compare various fits. Similarly, it was challenging understanding how to troubleshoot using bounding conditions in my minimization function (#thanksWillow).

I gained experience using emcee to implement MH-MCMC and setting up posterior, likelihoods, and prior distribution in the context of my data.
