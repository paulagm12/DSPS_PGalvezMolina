This assignment was worked in collaboration with Masooma Sarfraz. I consulted Tali Natan and Shar Daniels. However, I mostly worked independently, and consulted with TA Willow.

The homework had as a main goal to use the George python library to use a Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) to extrapolate data. It gave us experience writing general functions for generating the model and optimizing it using it in the data set from the average sea temperature from El Ni√±o. We also practiced visualizing our data and model.

The hardest part was setting up the interpolated time (going from months to days so that they also are ordered and in between months). I also struggled choosing a kernel, but after discussing with Willow I understood that that decision is usually done over theoretical information from the data that we do not posses nor need (#thanksWillow).

I gained experience using George package for GPRs and generating functions.
