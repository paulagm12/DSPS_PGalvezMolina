This assignment was worked independently. I worked with Miles Garcia on understanding what the plot of prediction over positions bins graphs were plotting. Sarah Dellorco consulted with me over the meanings of some graphs.

The homework had as a main goal to use set up Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNS) on a partial differentiation (Burger's equations) problem and compare our solutions to known analytical solutions. We started by creating a very vaguely informed model and continued to limit the domain of our loss function to make it more physically inoformed. Afterwards, we changed the learning rate and let it run for more epochs to get better training.

The hardest part was understanding some of the code that was not commented.

I gained more understanding on the effect that the loss function, learning rate, and number of epochs have on the performance of a model. I also understood what TA Willow and Prof. Bianco meant by the allocated Colab resources of the GPU time (***smiles in pain***) while it got fixed at the end, it was disturbing not getting the same results nor being able to run the code properly). I learned that running the code with a GPU does not yield the same results
