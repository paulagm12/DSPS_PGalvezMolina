This assignment was worked in collaboration with Shar Daniels and Tali Natan. 
The three of us asked questions to our TA, Willow, regarding the first assignment and then worked independently on the second notebook.

Shar shared code for implementing some distributions in the first notebook. Tali and I gave theoretical contributions on how the distribution worked.
For the second assginment, I got clarifications on some of the instructions for the binomial distributions from Tali.

The homework was about the various distributions avaible for use, how they behave, and how to use Python to obtain them and plot them. 
We also experienced how the law of large numbers applies in our distributions and how to obtain the information for the best fit to our plots.
All of this related to the revies of statistics we had in the lecture.

The hardest part of the assignment was working with the binomial distribution as I struggled to determine whether the probability and number of trials 
were fixed or not. I struggled with clearly understanding the instructions.

On the other hand, the easist was to generate the first 3 types of distributions and using the nested dictionary. In fact, the usage of nested
dictionaries is one of the things I learned from this assingment as well as the use of the optimiation function from scipy to better the fit of my curves.
